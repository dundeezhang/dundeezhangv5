# Reflections on My First Two Years at Waterloo

As I wrap up another term at the University of Waterloo, I find myself reflecting on the journey so far. The past two years have been a whirlwind of late-night coding sessions, hackathons, co-op experiences, and personal growth. Here are some thoughts on what I've learned.

## The Academic Challenge

Waterloo's Computer Science program is no joke. Coming in, I thought I was prepared, but courses like CS 246 (Object-Oriented Programming) and CS 341 (Algorithms) really pushed me to my limits.

The workload is intense. There were weeks where I'd spend 60+ hours between lectures, assignments, and projects. But this intensity taught me something valuable: how to manage my time and prioritize what truly matters.

## The Co-op Experience

The co-op program is what sets Waterloo apart. My first co-op term at airfairness was eye-opening. I went from writing academic code to working on production systems that thousands of users depend on. The pressure was real, but so was the learning.

Currently, I'm working at CodeRabbit as an engineer, and it's been an incredible experience. Building AI-powered code review tools has given me exposure to machine learning, large-scale systems, and the importance of code quality.

## The CS Club Leadership

One of my proudest achievements has been serving as President of the UW Computer Science Club. Leading an organization with such a rich history (it's one of the oldest CS clubs in the world!) has been both challenging and rewarding.

We've organized countless events, maintained our servers, and built a community where students can learn and grow together. The administrative work was sometimes tedious, but seeing first-year students get excited about programming made it all worthwhile.

## The Hackathon Scene

Waterloo has an incredible hackathon culture. Cofounding NRGHacks was one of the most ambitious projects I've undertaken. Bringing together sponsors, participants, and mentors to create a 24-hour coding marathon was logistically challenging but incredibly fulfilling.

I've participated in Hack the North, TerrHacks, and numerous other hackathons. While the projects I built were cool, the real value was in the friendships formed and the creative problem-solving under pressure.

## The Toronto Connection

Being from Toronto, I initially worried about adjusting to Waterloo's smaller city vibe. But I've come to appreciate it. The focus is different here—less distraction, more depth. That said, the GO train back to Toronto on weekends has become my friend.

## Technical Growth

Looking back at my code from two years ago is... embarrassing. But that's a good sign! I've grown tremendously as a developer:

- Learned multiple languages: TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust
- Built full-stack applications from scratch
- Contributed to open source projects
- Understood system design principles
- Developed a sense for clean, maintainable code

## The Challenges

It hasn't all been smooth sailing. There were:
- Assignments I failed despite giving my all
- Interviews I bombed spectacularly
- Projects that seemed impossible at 3 AM
- Moments of imposter syndrome
- Burnout from overcommitting

But each challenge taught me something. Failure isn't the opposite of success; it's part of the journey.

## The Community

The people I've met at Waterloo are incredible. From study groups grinding through algorithms problems to late-night philosophical discussions about technology's role in society, the intellectual community here is special.

## Looking Forward

With two years down and more to go, I'm excited for what's next. I want to:
- Dive deeper into systems programming
- Build more ambitious personal projects
- Continue growing the CS Club community
- Explore research opportunities
- Keep writing on this blog

## Advice for Future Waterlooers

If you're coming to Waterloo CS, here's my advice:

1. **Balance is key**: Don't sacrifice everything for grades
2. **Build projects**: Your portfolio matters more than your GPA
3. **Get involved**: Join clubs, attend events, meet people
4. **Use co-op wisely**: It's your chance to explore different roles
5. **Take care of yourself**: Mental health > everything else
6. **Don't compare**: Everyone's journey is different

## Conclusion

Waterloo has shaped me in ways I couldn't have imagined. It's been challenging, exhausting, and absolutely worth it. Here's to the next chapter.

Stay curious, stay humble, and keep building cool things.

Love from Waterloo (but my heart's still in Toronto <3).
